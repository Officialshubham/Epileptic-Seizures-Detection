**Purpose of Project**

**Statement 1**: A seizure is self diagnosable but it is apparent only when someone is having extreme symptoms and are visually recognizable. 
So it is very beneficial if seizure is detected at an early stage with both accuracy and less time consumption.<br>

**Statement 2**: Recently some systems are developed with ability to detect seizure with help of algorithm using EEG data, sensors and video or audio input. 
However, even after such inventions it is unclear of what technologies combined can give best output in detecting a seizure. The existing system shows less accuracy of about 0.64 or 64% and more time consumption.<br>

**Statement 3**: If the same situation continues, the same types of systems are continued to be made both time and hard work would go to waste. Moreover time is very essential in regard of the patient. Early and accurate detection is the main objective. <br>

**Research**: This study attempts to classify seizures and differentiate seizure and non seizure EEG via application of machine learning and spread this learning for aid. 
The main objective of this study is to detect epileptic seizures with greater accuracy and less time consumption with help of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms .
